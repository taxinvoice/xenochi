            How often the input system collects sensor data and runs the mapper.
            Lower values = more responsive but higher CPU usage.

            Common values:
            - 50ms (20Hz) - Very responsive, high CPU
            - 100ms (10Hz) - Default, good balance
            - 500ms (2Hz) - Low power mode
            - 1000ms (1Hz) - Very low power

    config MIBUDDY_API_URL
        string "API endpoint URL"
        default "http://10.0.13.101:8080/mochi/state"
        help

            The mochi will POST sensor data and receive state/activity response.
